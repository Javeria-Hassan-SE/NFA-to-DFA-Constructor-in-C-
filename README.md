# NFA-to-DFA-Constructor-in-C#

## Project Name: NFA to DFA Conversion and String Validation Tool

## Project Description:
The NFA to DFA Conversion and String Validation Tool is a Windows Form program developed in C# that enables users to input alphabets, states, initial state, final states, and transition functions for a Non-Deterministic Finite Automaton (NFA). The program determines if the input is an NFA, performs input string validation against the NFA, and provides the output of acceptance or rejection. Additionally, the tool offers the option to convert the NFA into a Deterministic Finite Automaton (DFA) and displays the DFA's alphabet, initial and final states, states, and transitions.

## Key Features:

## NFA Input and Validation:

User Input: The program allows users to input the necessary information for an NFA, including the alphabets, states, initial state, final states, and transition functions.
NFA Determination: The application validates the input data to ensure it represents a valid NFA according to the defined rules and constraints.
Input String Validation: Users can input a string to be validated against the NFA, and the program determines whether the input string is accepted or rejected by the NFA.

## NFA to DFA Conversion:

Conversion Option: The tool provides the functionality to convert the input NFA into a DFA, which is a deterministic version of the NFA.
DFA Generation: Upon selecting the conversion option, the program generates the DFA using the powerset construction algorithm or other suitable conversion techniques.
DFA Output: The generated DFA is displayed, showing the alphabet, initial and final states, states, and transitions of the converted automaton.


## Technologies and Techniques Used:

C#: The project is developed using the C# programming language, leveraging its features and libraries for Windows Forms application development.
Windows Forms: The user interface is built using the Windows Forms framework, providing a graphical interface for user interaction.
NFA and DFA Concepts: The project implements concepts and algorithms related to Non-Deterministic Finite Automaton (NFA) and Deterministic Finite Automaton (DFA) theory.
String Validation: The tool utilizes string manipulation and algorithmic techniques to validate input strings against the NFA or DFA.
The NFA to DFA Conversion and String Validation Tool offers a user-friendly interface for inputting and validating NFAs, as well as converting them into DFAs. By providing the option to validate input strings and determining acceptance or rejection, the tool assists in verifying whether a given string is accepted by the NFA or DFA. This project aims to facilitate the understanding and analysis of automata theory by providing an interactive tool for NFA conversion and string validation.
